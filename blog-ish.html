            <p quick-intro class="steps">So Day 2 of class ... Tough day... The magic of git
                I know modt if not all of us managed to complete the task with or without some help.
                If you did it without any help... bye bye this is not for you.
                If this was Greek to you then welcome home.
            </p>

            <p class="steps"> The first step is to create a repository or a working folder.
                This can be done either locally on your laptop or online on github.com . 
                I prefer to do it online on github since it makes the other steps more seamless.
            </p>
            <h3> Method 1 - Localy :ps I don't like it so google on your own :-)</h3>
            <h3>Method 2 - Github.com  : heeey !</h3>
            <p class="steps"> Go to github.com , login to your account.
                Go to top right corner and click the plus sign...
                yea that is the new repository button. click it like you have beef.
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="There is supposed to be a screenshot here but there was no internet" srcset="">
            <p class="steps">
                Now fill in the repository name 
                <em>remember to use descriptive or fun names</em>
                Add a description about what the repo is about too.
                Tick the initialize Readme checkbox 
                --we will come back to that later
                Ofcourse now is a good time to click create.
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="There is supposed to be a screenshot here too" srcset="">
            <p class="steps">
                First part is done ... I know you're wondering when we are going to use the terminal right? no?
                Here comes the juicy part.
                On your newly created  repository , there is a clone or download button.
                click on the clone part. 
                A link pops up in a boxy-thing. select the link and copy it.
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="You know the drill" srcset="">
            <p class="steps">
                Now on your terminal or git bash `cd to the directory/folder you want to clone your repo to. 
                I will use the desktop folder so I will cd to it
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="TYou do know there are times there was no screenshots right?" srcset="">
            <pre>cd Desktop</pre>
            <p class="steps">
                Now type git clone and paste the link you copied next to it and hit enter
            </p>
            <pre>git clone https://github.com/lawrence-chege/first-challenge.git</pre>
            <p class="steps">Wait for it to finish ... that shouldn't take long 
                Now lets do the work-ish... 
                cd into the cloned folder ... in my case its `first-challenge`
            </p>
            <pre>cd first-challenge</pre>
            <p class="steps">Next we are going to create the `index.html` file.
                You could call it anyway you want but the name index.html is recomended for the start page
            especially since we are going to host it on github pages...but we will get to that later </p>
            <pre>touch index.html</pre>
            <p class="steps">Now open the file with whichever text-editor you have and write the html code 
                pause tutorial and write the code ... don't copy paste or you will never learn.
                are you done now? 
                lets now tell git that we are done with updating the file.
                we use git add `filename` . This tells git to start tracking the changes made to that file.
            </p>
            <pre>git add index.html</pre>
            <p class="steps"> Now lets tell git to save the instance of that file...
                we do this using the git commit -m "message of what was chaged"
                keep the message concise ,descriptive and in present contionous tense.
                like an instruction to someone --- there are other ways but that is for later
            </p>
            <pre>git commit -m "add hello world to page"</pre>
            <p class="steps">Now that git has saved the instance of the file locally, 
                you can continue working on the file and keep saving other instances/checkpoints or
                you can push the saved checkpoint to the online repository.
                We do that by using the git push command.
            
            </p>
            <pre>git push origin master</pre>
            <p class="steps"> am tired now and its late... 
                the github publishing is for kesho...maybe 
                plus there is no internet :-(
